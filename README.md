# Guess the Word

# Description
"Guess the Word" is an engaging word-guessing game developed using Android Jetpack Compose. The game presents users with a text field to guess the word and provides hints to aid in the guessing process. Incorrect letters are displayed, and if the user fails to guess the word, they can restart the game using a button. Upon correctly guessing the word, the game automatically advances to the next word. This project requires an active internet connection.
